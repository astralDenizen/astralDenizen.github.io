            Hey everyone!
            <br>
            A new server is about to release... all due to the request of some members.  I'm sure you're all so excited, and that a lot of people are gonna come to release day. (that was sarcasm)
            <br><br>
            November 19. BE THERE.

                    Inertial Industries, a company dedicated to keeping your future advanced and filled with lights, screens, and the most modern and bleeding-edge technology to date, whether it be at the risk of anything. They've supplied us with the devices we need to effectively operate in this world... but still not as good as the real deal.
                    <br><br>
                    We've heard that the real deal is somewhere outside this plane but within the cybersphere, but in an unstable anchor plane. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOCATE IT. That's why we have AEROs.
