                This was a really quick but cool addition I made after discovering the motd plugin. Reminds me of the splash text from the title screen.
                <br>- Added a new MOTD(message of the day) plugin, ServerlistMOTD. You can see semi-random MOTDs now on the server list.

                Did you know, these updates are just me putting new plugins or changing config files for the plugins. The only actual amount of coding I do is actually writing this changelog site. Really sad, isn't it?
                <br>- New plugin: GSit. Use /sit or right click on some stairs to sit down. Simple.
                <br>- Allowed bed explosions in the nether for blast mining.
                <br>- Added a server icon.
                <br>I try to roll out a new update or patch at the end of each day, improving the player's experience a little bit every day. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to send me a message.
